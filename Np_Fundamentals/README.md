# Fundamentals of NumPy – Notebook Overview

## Introduction
This notebook provides a structured explanation of **NumPy**, a core Python library for numerical and scientific computing.
It covers concepts with clear explanations, code examples, and practical demonstrations.

## Contents

### 1. **What is NumPy?**
- Overview of **NumPy** and its role in numerical analysis and data processing.
- Performance benefits compared to Python lists.

### 2. **Key Features**
- **`ndarray`** – n-dimensional array object for efficient data storage.
- Vectorized mathematical operations.
- Logical operations, sorting, filtering, and reshaping arrays.
- Built-in modules for:
  - Linear algebra
  - Statistics
  - Random number generation
  - Fourier transforms
  - Input/Output operations

### 3. **Array Creation**
- Creating arrays from Python lists.
- Using functions: `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`.
- Random number generation with `np.random`.

### 4. **Array Operations**
- Element-wise arithmetic operations.
- Scalar operations.
- Mathematical functions: `np.sqrt()`, `np.exp()`, `np.sin()`, etc.

### 5. **Indexing & Slicing**
- Single and multi-dimensional indexing.
- Boolean indexing and conditional filtering.

### 6. **Shape & Reshaping**
- Understanding `.shape`, `.ndim`, `.size`.
- Reshaping with `.reshape()` and `.ravel()`.
- Transposing arrays with `.T`.

### 7. **Common Functions**
- Sorting: `np.sort()`.
- Unique values: `np.unique()`.
- Combining arrays: `np.concatenate()`, `np.vstack()`, `np.hstack()`.
- Aggregations: `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.min()`, `.max()`.
